# TImeBurg

Educational project
Short description:
Time tracking app.
Gamification is used in the form of building your own unique city. When tracking time in the application, a house is being built. The appearance of the house is selected based on the time spent. Houses can be improved.
Every month the user builds a new city. The old city remains in the statistics and the user can compare his progress.


Design and all buildings for the application are drawn by myself
